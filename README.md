Streamlit based application: Waste Classification to organic or recyclable using VGG16 model with dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data

## model
The model.tflite file used can be taken from Huggingface with the link: https://huggingface.co/migz117/Waste-VGG16/tree/main

## streamlit and mobile app
You can access the app using this link: https://aol-machinelearning.streamlit.app/

Outside of the final project, We also created a mobile application using Android Studio with this model, that can be downloaded as the APK file of the application via this following link: https://huggingface.co/MichaelIvanS/VGG16-WasteClassification/resolve/main/wastedetector.apk . The folder named WasteDetector contains several files from Android Studio that are considered important, not all files or folders are provided because the size will be too large.
