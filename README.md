Streamlit based application: Waste Classification to organic or recyclable using VGG16 model with dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data

The model.tflite file used can be taken from Huggingface with the link: https://huggingface.co/migz117/Waste-VGG16/tree/main

You can access the app using this link: https://aol-machinelearning.streamlit.app/

We also created a mobile application using Android Studio with this model that can be downloaded as the APK file of the application via this following link: https://huggingface.co/MichaelIvanS/VGG16-Deepfake/resolve/main/deepfakedetector.apk . The folder named DeepfakeDetector contains several files from Android Studio that are considered important, not all files or folders are provided because the size will be too large. However, there is a drawback in this project where the dataset used is less suitable for its use, namely detecting deepfakes so that it will be less accurate in practice. So I and my new team created a similar project but with a better dataset and model creation to detect waste classification: organic or recyclable which can be accessed at the following link: https://github.com/Mis-291205/AoL-MachineLearning
